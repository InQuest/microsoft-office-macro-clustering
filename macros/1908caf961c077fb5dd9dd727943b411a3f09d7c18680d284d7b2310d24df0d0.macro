' This custom date picker can be used by importing the CalendarForm.frm file into
' your VBA project. It is called exclusively through the GetDate function. For
' instructions on how to call on the CalendarForm, skip to the GetDate function
' documentation after the Global Variables section.

' Overview
'
' The goal in creating this form was first and foremost to overcome the monstrosity that
' is the Microsoft MonthView control. If you're reading this, you probably already know
' what I'm talking about. Many others have been in my place and have come up with their
' own date pickers to solve this problem. So why yet another custom date picker?
'
' I was most interested in the following features:
'   -Ease of use. I wanted a completely self-contained form that could be imported into
'       any VBA project and used without any additional coding.
'   -Simple, attractive design. While a lot of custom date pickers on the internet look
'       good and work well, none of them quite nailed it for me in terms of style and
'       UI design.
'   -Fully customizable functionality and look. I tried to include as many of the
'       options from the MonthView control as I could, without getting too messy.
'
' Since none of the date pickers I have been able to find in all my searching have quite
' completed my checklist, here we are! Now my hope is that some other tired soul may
' also benefit from my labors.
'
' If you encounter any bugs, or have any great ideas or feature requests that could
' improve this bad boy, please send me an email.
'
' What's new in v1.5.2:
'   -Bug fix: Userform not sizing properly in Word 2013
'   -Bug fix: Minimum font size not being preserved correctly
'   -Bug fix: Replaced WorksheetFunction.Max with custom Max function for compatibility
'       with other Office programs

' GetDate
'
' This function is the point of entry into the CalendarForm. It controls EVERYTHING.
' Every argument is optional, meaning your function call can be as simple as:
'
'   MyDateVariable = CalendarForm.GetDate
'
' That's all there is to it. The calendar initializes, pops up, the user selects a date,
' the selection is received by your variable, and the calendar unloads.
'
' From there, you can use as many or as few arguments as you want in order to get the
' desired calendar that suits your needs. All default values are also set in this
' function, so if you want to change default colors or behavior without having to
' explicitly do so in every function call, you can set those in the argument list
' here.
'
' Below is a list of all arguments, their data type, and their function:
'   SelectedDate (Date) - This is the initial selected date on the calendar. Used to
'       show the users last selection. If this value is set, the calendar will
'       initialize to the month and year of the SelectedDate. If not, it will
'       initialize to today's date (with no selection).
'   FirstDayOfWeek (calDayOfWeek) - Sets which day to use as first day of the week.
'   MinimumDate (Date) - Restricts the selection of any dates below this date.
'   MaximumDate (Date) - Restricts the selection of any dates above this date.
'   RangeOfYears (Long) - Sets the range of years to show in the year combobox in
'       either direction from the initial SelectedDate. For example, if the
'       SelectedDate is in 2014, and the RangeOfYears is set to 10 (the default value),
'       the year combobox will show 10 years below 2014 to 10 years above 2014, so it
'       will have a range of 2004-2024. Note that if this range falls outside the bounds
'       set by the MinimumDate or MaximumDate, it will be overridden. Also, this
'       range does NOT limit the years that a user can select. If the upper limit of
'       the year combobox is 2024, and the user clicks the month spinner to surpass
'       December 2024, it will keep right on going to 2025 and beyond (and those
'       years will be added to the year combobox).
'   DateFontSize (Long) - Controls the size of the CalendarForm. This value cannot
'       be set below 9 (the default). To make the form bigger, set this value larger,
'       and everything else in the userform will be resized to fit.
'   TodayButton (Boolean) - Controls whether or not the Today button is visible.
'   OkayButton (Boolean) - Controls whether or not the Okay button is visible. If the
'       Okay button is enabled, when the user selects a date, it is highlighted, but
'       is not returned until they click Okay. If the Okay button is disabled,
'       clicking a date will automatically return that date and unload the form.
'   ShowWeekNumbers (Boolean) - Controls the visibility of the week numbers.
'   FirstWeekOfYear (calFirstWeekOfYear) - Sets the behavior of the week numbers. See
'       the calFirstWeekOfYear Enum in the Global Variables section to see the possible
'       values and their behavior.
'   PositionTop (Long) - Sets the top position of the CalendarForm. If no value is
'       assigned, the CalendarForm is set to position 1 - CenterOwner. Note that
'       PositionTop and PositionLeft must BOTH be set in order to override the default
'       center position.
'   PositionLeft (Long) - Sets the left position of the CalendarForm. If no value is
'       assigned, the CalendarForm is set to position 1 - CenterOwner. Note that
'       PositionTop and PositionLeft must BOTH be set in order to override the default
'       center position.
'   BackgroundColor (Long) - Sets the background color of the CalendarForm.
'   HeaderColor (Long) - Sets the background color of the header. The header is the
'       month and year label at the top.
'   HeaderFontColor (Long) - Sets the color of the header font.
'   SubHeaderColor (Long) - Sets the background color of the subheader. The subheader
'       is the day of week labels under the header (Su, Mo, Tu, etc).
'   SubHeaderFontColor (Long) - Sets the color of the subheader font.
'   DateColor (Long) - Sets the background color of the individual date labels.
'   DateFontColor (Long) - Sets the font color of the individual date labels.
'   SaturdayFontColor (Long) - Sets the font color of Saturday date labels.
'   SundayFontColor (Long) - Sets the font color of Sunday date labels.
'   DateBorder (Boolean) - Controls whether or not the date labels have borders.
'   DateBorderColor (Long) - Sets the color of the date label borders. Note that the
'       argument DateBorder must be set to True for this setting to take effect.
'   DateSpecialEffect (fmSpecialEffect) - Sets a special effect for the date labels.
'       This can be set to bump, etched, flat (default value), raised, or sunken.
'       This can be used to make the date labels look like buttons if you desire.
'       Note that this setting overrides any date border settings you have made.
'   DateHoverColor (Long) - Sets the background color when hovering the mouse over
'       a date label.
'   DateSelectedColor (Long) - Sets the background color of the selected date.
'   TrailingMonthFontColor (Long) - Sets the color of the date labels in trailing
'       months. Trailing months are the date labels from last month at the top of the
'       calendar and from next month at the bottom of the calendar.
'   TodayFontColor (Long) - Sets the font color of today's date.

'   in 2014, combobox could then hold 2014, 2016, 2017, etc...
' -December 9999 generates an error when trying to calculate last day of month,  because
'   January 10000 is not a valid date in Excel
' -Occasionally, the month or year label is truncated. Cannot reproduce consistently

' Changelog
'
' v1.5.2
' -Bug fix: Userform not sizing properly in Word 2013
' -Bug fix: Minimum font size not being preserved correctly
' -Bug fix: Replaced WorksheetFunction.Max with custom Max function for compatibility
'   with other Office programs
'
' v1.5.1
' -Move all initialization code from GetDate and SetUserformSize to InitializeUserform
' -Fully qualify "Control" declarations as "MSForms.Control" for compatibility with Access
' -Bug fix: Eliminated FindLastDayOfMonth function, which contained a leap year bug
' -Bug fix: Calendar frame not setting background color correctly
' -Bug fix: Hover over calendar frame clears hovered control
'
' v1.5.0
' -Added a frame around all calendar elements. Calendar now positions and sizes itself
'   relative to its frame, rather than the userform as a whole. This way, the frame
'   can be placed anywhere within a larger userform to use it as an embedded calendar
'   rather than a popup. If you size the userform larger than the calendar, it will
'   remain that size, so you can add other controls.
'
' v1.4.0
' -Initial public release
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
' Future enhancements
'
' -Calculate all userform colors off one color argument, to reduce the wall of
'   arguments in GetDate function
' -Combine DateBorder and DateSpecialEffect arguments to one enumeration, since they
'   cancel eachother out
' -Remove userform toolbar (credit: Flemming Vadet, fv@smartoffice.dk, www.smartoffice.dk)
' -Remove extra row of trailing dates for months that have only 5 rows of dates, making
'   sure to handle special case of months with 4 rows, like Feb 2015 (credit: Greg Maxey,
'   gmaxey@mvps.org, gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tips.htm)
' -Today button selects date and closes if Okay disabled
' -Add Cancel button
' -Better diferrentiation between disabled dates and trailing month dates (credit: Greg
'   Maxey, gmaxey@mvps.org, gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tips.htm)
' -Move selected day calculation to SetDays function only, to avoid having to
'   redundantly calculate it in so many different functions
' -Add option to hide weekends (credit: Don Gray, don@rania.co.uk, www.rania.co.uk/ST)
' -Change cursor when hovering selectable controls
' -Month/Year in header change color on hover
' -Change buttons to flat labels w/ icons
' -Add tooltip when hovering over a date
' -Add worksheet to explain how to import/export userform
' -Add documentation explaining how to use with different date formats
